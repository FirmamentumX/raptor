        "Givanildo José de Oliveira ( born 8 August 1948 ) , known as Givanildo , is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a defensive midfielder , and is the manager of America .",
        "Playing career .",
        "Club .",
        "Born in Olinda , Pernambuco , Givanildo represented Santa Cruz as a youth and made his first team debut in 1969 . A part of the clubs five consecutive Campeonato Pernambucano titles , he also became team captain in the process .",
        "In 1976 Givanildo moved to Corinthians , but was sparingly used and subsequently returned to Santa in the following year . In 1980 , after a short stint at Fluminense , he joined state rivals Sport , eventually retiring with the club in 1983 at nearly 35 years of age .",
        "International .",
        "Givanildo represented Brazil on 13 occasions ( six of them official ) , with his debut occurring on 31 May 1976 in 4–1 routing of Italy for the 1976 U.S.A . Bicentennial Cup Tournament .",
        "Managerial career .",
        "Givanildos first managerial job came on 1983 at Sport , immediately after retiring . His first accolade as a manager occurred in 1986 , as he won the Campeonato Alagoano with CRB .",
        "In 1987 , while in charge of Paysandu , Givanildo won the years Campeonato Paraense , and subsequently returned to his first club Santa Cruz in 1989 . He left the club in the following year , and was subsequently in charge of CSA ( two stints ) , Paysandu , Sport ( three stints ) , Central , Ponte Preta ( two stints ) , Remo , Bragantino , CRB , Náutico ( two stints ) , Guarani , Bahia and América Mineiro ; with the latter he achieved promotion to the Série A in 1997 .",
        "In 1998 , Givanildo rejoined Santa after leaving América , and went back to Paysandu in April 2000 , leading the latter club to the top tier in 2001 and winning the 2002 Copa dos Campeões , which qualified his side to the 2003 Copa Libertadores . He resigned in September 2002 , and subsequently took over Náutico .",
        "In April 2003 , Givanildo was named manager of Remo , and left the club in December . For the 2004 season , he was named manager five times in four clubs ; starting with Paysandu , he only lasted one month before turning out to Fortaleza . He eventually returned to Papão in April , being dismissed in August and taking over Remo , but finished the campaign in charge of Santa Cruz .",
        "Givanildo remained in charge of Santa Cruz until April 2006 , when he resigned to take over Atlético Paranaense . Dismissed in July , he led Sport to the second place of the Série B .",
        "In 2007 , Givanildo had unassuming spells at Santa Cruz , Vitória and Brasiliense ; at the latter , he was in charge for just three matches , all defeats . He returned to Paysandu for the 2008 season , but stepped down and took over Vila Nova in April , staying at the club until the following February .",
        "On 17 March 2009 , Givanildo was appointed manager of Mogi Mirim , but moved to América Mineiro the following month . On 10 November , after winning the Série C with the latter , he took over Sport .",
        "On 19 July 2010 , Givanildo returned to Santa . In September he resigned , and took over Ponte Preta on 25 October .",
        "On 18 May 2011 , Givanildo rejoined Remo for a fourth spell . On 1 August he returned to América Mineiro , and subsequently took over Paysandu ( two stints ) , ABC and Treze before rejoining the club on 17 September 2014 .",
        "On 3 June 2016 , Givanildo was sacked by América . On 5 September , he took over Náutico , but was dismissed on 2 December after failing to achieve promotion .",
        "On 17 February 2017 , Givanildo was announced at Ceará . On 2 July he returned to Santa Cruz for a sixth spell , but was relieved from his duties on 27 August .",

      "Sabine Hossenfelder",
      "Sabine Hossenfelder ( born 18 September 1976 ) is a German author and theoretical physicist who researches quantum gravity . She is a Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies where she leads the Superfluid Dark Matter group . She is the author of Lost in Math : How Beauty Leads Physics Astray , which explores the concept of elegance in fundamental physics and cosmology .",
      "Education .",
      "Hossenfelder completed her undergraduate degree in 1997 at Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t in Frankfurt am Main . She remained there for a Masters degree , and she wrote a thesis under the supervision of Walter Greiner titled Particle Production in Time Dependent Gravitational Fields , which she completed in 2000 . Hossenfelder received her doctorate from the same institution in 2003 , for the thesis Black Holes in Large Extra Dimensions under the supervision of Horst St\u00f6cker .",
      "Research .",
      "Hossenfelder remained in Germany until 2004 as a postdoctoral researcher at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt , Germany . She moved to North America and completed research fellowships at the University of Arizona , Tucson , University of California , Santa Barbara and Perimeter Institute , Canada . She joined Nordita Institute for Theoretical Physics , Sweden , in 2009 as an Assistant Professor . In 2018 she was a Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies .",
      "Hossenfelders research interest is in the phenomenology of quantum gravity . She focuses on the role of Lorentz invariance and locality , which would be altered in the discovery of quantum gravity . Hossenfelder is trying to find experimental evidence of quantum gravity . Since 2007 she has been involved with the annual conference series Experimental Search for Quantum Gravity . Hossenfelder has created a number of YouTube videos exploring the topic . She has been employed by the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies since 2015 , where she leads the Analog Systems for Gravity Duals group . Another area of her research are foundations of quantum mechanics , where she has argued against free will and in favor of superdeterminism .",
      "Hossenfelder has also been researching since at least 2008 on how technology is changing researchers ability to publicize , discuss , or publish their research , when she co-organized the Science in the 21st Century workshop .",
      "Public engagement and scientific achievements .",
      "Hossenfelder is a freelance popular science writer who has kept a blog since 2006 . She contributes to the Forbes column Starts with a Bang as well as Quanta Magazine , New Scientist , Nature Physics , Scientific American , Nautilus Quarterly and Physics Today . To show some gaps in the argument of Verlindes claim that gravity is an entropic force , she derived Verlindes formula for Newtons law of universal gravitation using a new form of an entropic variation formula that reduces to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the black hole event horizon . In 2016 , Hossenfelder offered to act as a physics consultant on her blog\u2014US$50 for twenty minutes of discussion\u2014and had to recruit five extra physicists to deal with the demand . In 2017 she created cards featuring pioneering quantum physicists . Live Science and The Guardian quoted Hossenfelder as an authority when trying to evaluate the importance of Stephen Hawkings last scientific publication .",
      "Basic Books are the publishers of Hossenfelders first book , Lost in Math : How Beauty Leads Physics Astray , released in June 2018 . A review in Nature described it as provocative , and Frank Wilczek recommended it as an intensely personal and intellectually hard-edged book , even though he disagreed with it on many points . Peter Woit summarized the books theme as follows :",
      "Hossenfelder also is invited for talks , about What is wrong with physics for example .",
      "Her 2018 book , Lost in Math , was also published in German with the title , Das h\u00e4ssliche Universum ( The Ugly Universe ) . Hossenfelder posits that the universe ( and its particle model ) is messy , and that it cannot be described by a mathematical ( beautiful ) Great Unified Theory .",
      "She currently has an eponymously-named YouTube channel ( subtitled Science without the gobbledygook ) .",
